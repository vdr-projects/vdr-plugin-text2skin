How To create text-based skins
------------------------------

[ TODO remove this ]
You may encounter bracketed phrases in this document. Please ignore them, they
are comments for me which will be removed in official release versions.

[ TODO move this to manual ]
The Skin itself is located in a subdirectory "text2skin" inside the "plugins" 
directory of your VDR configuration directory. This usually is the video 
directory, if you didn't specify -c on the commandline. If you did, the 
subdirectory is located there.  Each skin has an own subdirectory there, which 
holds the skin description file and the needed image files. The skin 
description file must have the same name as the skin directory, with the 
extension ".skin"

Example (the Skin is called myskin):
/video0/plugins/text2skin/
/video0/plugins/text2skin/myskin/
/video0/plugins/text2skin/msykin/msykin.skin
/video0/plugins/text2skin/myskin/channeldisplay.png

It is important that you understand the limitations of the OSD memory. If there
are too many objects with too many colors defined, VDR will throw an error and
some areas will not be displayed. For other output devices this limitations may
not apply, so if you are planning to design a skin for another output device,
feel free to use more colors, but remember that VDR can handle a maximum of 256
areas per object.

An object is defined to be a specific area with a specific palette and color 
depth. Those objects will be referred to as 'backgrounds' later on. Calculate
the dimensions of them wisely, since overlapping areas or oversized areas will
lead to an error. Also, the widht and height of each area has to be a multiple
of four [ TODO may not apply to different output devices ].


Creation of an image
--------------------

I used gimp to create some test images displaying things on screen, although
I don't know much about image processing :-). To give an advice, I will point
out how I created those test images.

I've used a template for a menu provided by a community member, tiled it into
sections fully covered by the image. That made three images in this case. Then
I added a little bit of transparency to the image covering the middle part. I've
resized the image so that it's width and height were multiples of four. Now I've
added 50% transparency to the top layer of the image. Then I've reduced the 
colordepth of the image (Image->Mode->Indexed) to 14 colors (of course the 
image may not be too extensive, but 14 colors can give some nice gradients). 
That leaves two colors for text and progress bar in the same display. Reduce 
the number of colors according to the background depth and additional 
decoration you intend to use. I saved the results to a png file and placed the
result into the skin.

If you intend to use xpm's, be aware that VDR doesn't know about named colors,
so some images GIMP creates will not be read on-the-fly, because GIMP may use
some named colors, but VDR only recognizes "None".


The Description File Format
---------------------------

It is a simple configuration file, consisting of Sections and items. 
Commentary lines can be added when they are lead in by a '#'. Blank lines will
be ignored. A section is placed in '[]' brackets. An item is lead in by an 
'Item=object' phrase.

Example:
Item=Skin,name=Test,version=0.0.1;
[Channel]
Item=Background,path=channeltop.xpm,x=42,y=350,width=540,height=32,bg=#00FFFFFF;
Item=Background,path=channel.png,x=48,y=382,width=528,height=84;
Item=ChannelNumberName,x=50,y=355,fg=#FFFFFFFF,bg=#FF1965FF,font=Sml;
Item=PresentTime,x=52,y=387,fg=#FFFFFFFF,bg=#7F002254,font=Osd;
[Volume]
Item=Background,x=10,y=10,width=10,height=100;
Item=Volumebar,x=10,y=10,width=10,height=100,bg=#FF000000,fg=#FFFFFFFF;

Known Items
-----------

Item:        Item=Skin
Description: This identifies the skin and adds a description to it.
Parameters:  name, version

Item:        Item=Background
Description: This adds a background area for the specific display. This area 
             will be used to draw anything else, so you have to define a 
             background for everything that will be drawn later on. You can 
             define a background image for that area here, too. That picture
             has to be the same width and height as the area. If you don't use
             a background image, the area will be initialized with the bg color
             (default 0). If an image is present, the background color will 
             replace the color 0 in the images palette, and the foreground 
             color will replace color 1.
Parameters:  x, y, width, height, bpp, path, bg, fg

Item:        Item=Text
Description: Draws plain text into the given area, using the given foreground
             color. The background color is ignored, so no initializing 
             rectangle will be drawn. If no width or height are given, the
             limits are the background areas.
Parameters:  x, y, text, width, height, fg, font, align

Item:        Item=Image
Description: Draws a plain image into the given area, using background and 
             foreground color (if given) to replace the palette indices 0

             additional subdirectory to the skin's directory.
