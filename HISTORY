---------------------------------------

- fixed disappearing Scrolltext when Message was displayed
- fixed display-items "MenuScrollUp" and "MenuScrollDown" which didn't display
  any other items than "Symbol"

  (for all display-items that can be symbols there must be path, altpath or
  both to tell the plugin if that item is to be drawn if the symbol is on,
  off or in both cases)
- fixed various memory leaks and missing destructions (valgrind rox)
- fixed the image loaders to respect the alpha value and palette properly 
  (this hopefully also fixes the phenomenon that images "get lost" after some 
  time)
