VDR Plugin 'text2skin' Revision History
---------------------------------------

2005-06-xx: Version 1.1

- fixed a race condition (thanks to Reinhard Nissl for pointing this out)
- updated finnish translations (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg)
- added tokens for Recording Info Display
  (RecordingName, RecordingDateTime, RecordingTitle, RecordingShortText,
  RecordingDescription, RecordingLanguageCode, RecordingLanguageDescription)

2005-02-06: Version 1.0

- major rewrite
- xml-based format
- true type font support

2004-07-14: Version 0.0.8

- fixed display of scrollbar if there is no text present
- fixed animation delay if update takes longer than the delay
- using backgrounds also in 8-bit fullscreen mode to improve performance
- implemented screen layer to improve performance
- corrected offsets and tab widths in main menu
- implemented parameters "current", "mark" and "selected" to choose mark colors
  in replay display (defaults to the old values)
- implemented color value "None" to be able to unset a color

2004-06-25: Version 0.0.7

- on devices capable of full-color OSD, bpp's have no meaning anymore
  (but will still work like usual). On such devices, a full-screen 8-bit
  OSD will be used
- new display-item "PresentTextDescription" displays combined 
  ShortText/Description
- displaying replay symbols only if information is actually available
- exchanged x, y, width, height with x1, y1, x2, y2 coordinates
  (skin version is now 0.0.3)
- coordinates may be negative to respect dynamic OSD settings
  (negative coordinates give pixels from the right or bottom edge)
- added base parameter to Skin item to be able to use full screen in absolute
  mode
- added a script to convert 0.0.2 skins to 0.0.3
- added parsing quoted texts (path="Bla.jpg" etc. will work correctly now)

- fixed display of scrollbar (REALLY!)
- fixed linkage of libMagick++

2004-06-18: Version 0.0.6

- reimplemented image cache (fixes segfaults and speeds up image loading)
- fixed a recursion wenn de-initializing ImageMagick (crashes on exit)
- reverted the changes in ImageMagick-loader that concerned palettes
  (obviously some versions of ImageMagick are BROKEN!!! I am using 5.5.7 which
  works fine. Version 5.4.7 shows random errors)
- reimplemented "Flush image cache" into the setup menu
- included -lMagick into Makefile as a workaround for Debian (and others 
  possibly)
- fixed display of scrollbar

2004-06-16: Version 0.0.5

- fixed disappearing Scrolltext when Message was displayed
- fixed display-items "MenuScrollUp" and "MenuScrollDown" which didn't display
  any other items than "Symbol"
- fixed the above for all replay- and channel-symbols
  (for all display-items that can be symbols there must be path, altpath or
  both to tell the plugin if that item is to be drawn if the symbol is on,
  off or in both cases)
- fixed various memory leaks and missing destructions (valgrind rox)
- fixed the image loaders to respect the alpha value and palette properly 
  (this hopefully also fixes the phenomenon that images "get lost" after some 
  time)

- SKINS and SKINS.de are now generated during the make
