VDR Plugin 'text2skin' Revision History
---------------------------------------

2006-02-04: Version 1.1-cvs_ext-0.8 (vdr-text2skin-1.1-cvs_ext-0.8.diff)

- added a configuration option for showing the scrollbar in the menus and
  finished implementation

2006-02-04: Version 1.1-cvs_ext-0.7 (vdr-text2skin-1.1-cvs_ext-0.7.diff)

- changed the routines to determine the next timers
- added the possibility to have a scrollbar in every menu - not fully
  implemented yet (to position in menu-lists is not necessarily correct,
  if there are more items with the same osd-text)

2006-01-10: Version 1.1-cvs_ext-0.6 (vdr-text2skin-1.1-cvs_ext-0.6.diff)

- updated to cvs-version of text2skin
- since vdr-1.3.38 it is possible to exactly identify the replayed
  recording, so the replay-tokens work now
- switched the search-order for the fonts to priorise the skin-folder
  (this avoids error-messages in the log)

2006-01-07: Version 1.1-cvs_ext-0.5 (vdr-text2skin-1.1-cvs_ext-0.5.diff)

- modifications to compile with vdr-versions >= 1.3.18
- added tokens:
  OsdWidth, OsdHeight
- activating the token ReplayVideoAR

2005-12-18: Version 1.1-cvs_ext-0.4 (vdr-text2skin-1.1-cvs_ext-0.4.diff)

- modified the way, the current replayed recording is determined (status.c:
  cText2SkinStatus::Replaying)
  There remains a problem that recordings with the same name cannot be
  distinguished, so information optained from mReplay are not necessarily
  correct (all the ones added in vdr-text2skin-1.1-cvs_ext-0.2.diff)

2005-12-11: Version 1.1-cvs_ext-0.3 (vdr-text2skin-1.1-cvs_ext-0.3.diff)

- added recording-tokens:
  RecordingLength, RecordingCuttedLength

2005-11-19: Version 1.1-cvs_ext-0.2 (vdr-text2skin-1.1-cvs_ext-0.2.diff)

- removed the previously introduced tokens NextTimerName, NextTimerStart,
  NextTimerChannel, CurrentRecordingsCount and added tokens for the next
  3 timers: CurrentEventsTitle[123], CurrentEventsStartDateTime[123],
  CurrentEventsStopDateTime[123], CurrentEventsChannelNumber[123],
  CurrentEventsChannelName[123], CurrentEventsIsRecording[123]
- added audio- and video-tokens:
  PresentLanguageCode, PresentLanguageDescription, PresentVideoAR and
  implemented the missing code for the Language-token
- added tokens for replay:
  ReplayName, ReplayDateTime, ReplayShortText, ReplayDescription,
  ReplayLanguageCode, ReplayLanguageDescription, ReplayVideoAR
  (not activated yet)
- additional recording-tokens:
  RecordingVideoAR, RecordingSize

- included Text2skin.diff from the rotor-plugin

2005-10-22: Version 1.1-cvs_ext-0.1 (vdr-text2skin-1.1-cvs_ext-0.1.diff)

- added several tokens:
  NextTimerName, NextTimerStart, NextTimerChannel, TimerConflict,
  CurrentRecordingsCount, using the service "CheckTimerConflict-v1.0" to
  check timer conflicts. A patch for the timeline-plugin is included in
  Enigma-0.4pre2 (timeline_CheckTimerConflictService-0.1.diff)

2005-06-xx: Version 1.1

- true type font support

2004-07-14: Version 0.0.8

- fixed display of scrollbar if there is no text present
- fixed animation delay if update takes longer than the delay
- using backgrounds also in 8-bit fullscreen mode to improve performance
- implemented screen layer to improve performance
- corrected offsets and tab widths in main menu
- implemented parameters "current", "mark" and "selected" to choose mark colors
  in replay display (defaults to the old values)
- implemented color value "None" to be able to unset a color

2004-06-25: Version 0.0.7

- on devices capable of full-color OSD, bpp's have no meaning anymore
  (but will still work like usual). On such devices, a full-screen 8-bit
  OSD will be used
- new display-item "PresentTextDescription" displays combined 
  ShortText/Description
- displaying replay symbols only if information is actually available
- exchanged x, y, width, height with x1, y1, x2, y2 coordinates
  (skin version is now 0.0.3)
- coordinates may be negative to respect dynamic OSD settings
  (negative coordinates give pixels from the right or bottom edge)

  mode

2004-06-18: Version 0.0.6

- reimplemented image cache (fixes segfaults and speeds up image loading)
- fixed a recursion wenn de-initializing ImageMagick (crashes on exit)
- reverted the changes in ImageMagick-loader that concerned palettes
  (obviously some versions of ImageMagick are BROKEN!!! I am using 5.5.7 which
  works fine. Version 5.4.7 shows random errors)
- reimplemented "Flush image cache" into the setup menu
- included -lMagick into Makefile as a workaround for Debian (and others 
  possibly)
- fixed display of scrollbar

2004-06-16: Version 0.0.5

- fixed disappearing Scrolltext when Message was displayed
- fixed display-items "MenuScrollUp" and "MenuScrollDown" which didn't display
  any other items than "Symbol"
- fixed the above for all replay- and channel-symbols
  (for all display-items that can be symbols there must be path, altpath or
  both to tell the plugin if that item is to be drawn if the symbol is on,
  off or in both cases)
- fixed various memory leaks and missing destructions (valgrind rox)
- fixed the image loaders to respect the alpha value and palette properly 
  (this hopefully also fixes the phenomenon that images "get lost" after some 
  time)
